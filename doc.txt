In VSA for Catalog scenarios:
If you use a product link in your ad (shopping_ads_fallback_type is SHOPPING_ADS), you can add URL parameters to the product link by passing utm_params. The URL parameters will be automatically appended to the product link upon ad delivery.

In other scenarios, if you set landing_page_url to a URL that already includes URL parameters, you can optionally pass utm_params at the same time to store the URL parameters used in the URL. In such cases, you need to ensure that utm_params exactly matches the used URL parameters. The URL parameters will not be automatically appended to the landing_page_url upon ad delivery.
