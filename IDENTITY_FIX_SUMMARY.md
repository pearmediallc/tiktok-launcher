# TikTok Ad Creation - Identity Requirements Fixed

## Key Changes Made:

### 1. ✅ Identity is Now Properly Required
According to TikTok documentation (doc.txt):
- **identity_type and identity_id are REQUIRED fields** (lines 145-163)
- The API now validates that an identity is selected
- No more hardcoded fallback identity

### 2. ✅ Identity Fetching Enhanced
The application now:
- Fetches both CUSTOMIZED_USER and TT_USER identities
- Lists all available identities in the dropdown
- Shows identity type (Custom) or (TikTok) next to each option
- Passes both identity_id and identity_type to the API

### 3. ✅ API Structure Updated
```php
// API now requires identity
if (empty($data['identity_id'])) {
    return error('Identity is required for ad creation');
}

$creative = [
    'identity_type' => $data['identity_type'] ?? 'CUSTOMIZED_USER',
    'identity_id' => $data['identity_id'], // REQUIRED - no fallback
    // ... other fields
];
```

### 4. ✅ Frontend Validation
- Identity selection is now mandatory
- Shows error if no identity selected
- Passes identity_type along with identity_id

## How It Works Now:

1. **On Page Load:**
   - Fetches all CUSTOMIZED_USER identities
   - Fetches all TT_USER identities
   - Populates dropdown with all available identities

2. **Identity Selection:**
   - User MUST select an identity from dropdown
   - Each option shows: Name (Display Name) (Type)
   - Example: "Campaign Launcher (Custom)"

3. **Ad Creation:**
   - Validates identity is selected
   - Sends both identity_id and identity_type
   - API rejects request if no identity provided

## Testing Your Identities:

Run this command to see all available identities:
```bash
php test_identities.php
```

This will show:
- All CUSTOMIZED_USER identities
- All TT_USER identities
- Their IDs and names

## Complete Ad Creation Flow:

1. **Create Campaign** → Get campaign_id
2. **Create Ad Group** → Get adgroup_id
3. **Create Ads:**
   - Select media (video/image)
   - **SELECT IDENTITY** (required!)
   - Enter ad details
   - Review & Publish

## API Requirements Met:

✅ identity_type: Required field included
✅ identity_id: Required field included (from selection)
✅ video_id: Included for video ads
✅ image_ids: Included as video cover
✅ ad_format: Properly set (SINGLE_VIDEO/SINGLE_IMAGE)
✅ All other required fields per documentation

## No More Errors:

The application now properly:
1. Lists your existing custom identities
2. Requires identity selection
3. Validates before submission
4. Sends complete API request per TikTok docs

Your custom identities created in TikTok Ads Manager will now appear in the dropdown and can be selected for ad creation.
